# About the Micro Adventure novels
The [Micro Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Adventure) novels were a series of young adult books published by Scholastic in
1984 and 1985.  They are written in the second person to provide an immersive environment.  The reader takes on the role of a computer
expert for the ACT (Adventure Connection Team).

The book includes short [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) programs that can be [typed in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-in_program)
and ran in a traditional BASIC interpreter.  The programs enhance the story in the novels and add to the immersion. 

In the first novel, "Space Attack", ACT has provided you with a "special portable unit" for your field assignments.  It's described as
"state-of-the-art hardware packed into a machine the size of a pocket radio."  I think the Ti-74 BASICALC fits this description nicely.

# About the Ti-74 BASICALC
Released in 1985, the [TI-74](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-74) is a scientific calculator that is programmable using BASIC.  It has a
single-line LCD display.  It can display 31 characters on the screen at a time, from a scrollable 80 character line.  It runs a fairly
standard version of BASIC, with some special commands to make working with a single line display easier.

# About these listings
The listings for each novel are organized in a directory named for the novel number and title.  There are several branches available:  
- **published** the BASIC listing as it appears in the novel.  It is the IBM PC version.
- **ti74** the version adapted for running on the TI-74
- **answer** if the novel has you correcting a bug in the program, this is the corrected version for the IBM PC.
